A PROCLAMATION

Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(B)), the President may designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country if, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (the "Commission"), the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from least-developed beneficiary developing countries. 

In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles only when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1–Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in section A of Annex I to this proclamation.
