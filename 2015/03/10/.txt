SUBJECT:  A Student Aid Bill of Rights to Help Ensure Affordable Loan Repayment

America thrived in the 20th century in large part because we had the most educated workforce in the world.  Today, more than ever, Americans need knowledge and skills to meet the demands of a growing global economy.  Since many students borrow to pay for postsecondary education, it is imperative they be able to manage their debt as they embark on their careers. 

My Administration has taken historic action to ensure that college remains affordable and student debt remains manageable.  We have eliminated tens of billions of dollars in student loan subsidies paid to banks in order to increase the maximum Pell grant by nearly $1,000 and provide a path for borrowers to limit payments on many student loans to 10 percent of income, and we have worked with the Congress to enact the American Opportunity Tax Credit, worth $10,000 over 4 years of college.  We have promoted innovation and competition to bring down college costs,increased completion rates, and given consumers clear, transparent information on college performance. 

College remains an excellent investment, and student loans enable many who could not otherwise do so to access further education.  However, there is more work to do to help students repay their loans responsibly.  In 2013, college graduates owed an average of $28,400 in Federal and private loans.  More than one in eight Federal borrowers default on their loans within 3 years of leaving school.  My Administration has already  put in place significant protections that ensure borrowers with credit cards and mortgages are treated fairly.  We can and  should do much more to give students affordable ways to meet their responsibilities and repay their loans.

Now is the time for stronger protections for the more than 40 million Americans with student loan debt.  All student loan borrowers should have access to an efficient and responsive complaint and feedback system that holds loan servicers accountable and promotes transparency, the information and  flexibility they need to repay their loan responsibly and avoid default, and protections to ensure that they will be treated fairly even if they struggle to repay their loans.

Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:
