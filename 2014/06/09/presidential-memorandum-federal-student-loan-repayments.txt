MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION

SUBJECT: Helping Struggling Federal Student Loan Borrowers Manage Their Debt

A college education is the single most important investment that Americans can make in their futures. College remains a good investment, resulting in higher earnings and a lower risk of unemployment. Unfortunately, for many low- and middle-income families, college is slipping out of reach. Over the past three decades, the average tuition at a public four-year college has more than tripled, while a typical family&#39;s income has increased only modestly. More students than ever are relying on loans to pay for college. Today, 71 percent of those earning a bachelor&#39;s degree graduate with debt, which averages $29,400. While most students are able to repay their loans, many feel burdened by debt, especially as they seek to start a family, buy a home, launch a business, or save for retirement.

Over the past several years, my Administration has worked to ensure that college remains affordable and student debt is manageable, including through raising the maximum Pell Grant award by nearly $1,000, creating the American Opportunity Tax Credit, and expanding access to student loan repayment plans, where monthly obligations are calibrated to a borrower&#39;s income and debt. These income-driven repayment plans, like my Pay As You Earn plan, which caps a Federal student loan borrower&#39;s payments at 10 percent of income, can be an effective tool to help individuals manage their debt, and pursue their careers while avoiding consequences of defaulting on a Federal student loan, such as a damaged credit rating, a tax refund offset, or garnished wages.

While my Administration has made significant strides in expanding repayment options available to borrowers and building awareness of income-driven repayment plans, more needs to be done. Currently, not all student borrowers of Federal Direct Loans can cap their monthly loan payments at 10 percent of income, and too many struggling borrowers are still unaware of the options available to them to help responsibly manage their debt.

Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:
