A PROCLAMATION 

Sports keep children healthy, teach them to work as part of a team, and help them develop the discipline to achieve their goals. During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we encourage America&#39;s sons and daughters to get active and challenge everyone to join the movement for a happier, fitter Nation. 

For 4 years, First Lady Michelle Obama&#39;s Let&#39;s Move! 

By leading more active lifestyles, we can invest in our futures and encourage our children to do the same. This month, let us champion fitness to our family, friends, and colleagues. Let us give young people the chance to find a sport or physical activity they love, boost their energy and confidence, and reach their fullest potential. 

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2014 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United States to make daily physical activity, sports participation, and good nutrition a priority in their lives. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 

BARACK OBAMA
