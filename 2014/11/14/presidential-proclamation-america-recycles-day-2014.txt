As a Nation, we must do all we can to leave the next generation a cleaner, safer, and more stable world.  America&#39;s young people are tomorrow&#39;s environmental stewards, and it is our responsibility to instill in them a conservation ethic.  Recycling reduces our country&#39;s energy consumption, decreases our greenhouse gas emissions, and conserves our natural resources, and it is one of the first steps we can teach our children and grandchildren to take as part of their everyday lives.  It also creates green jobs in America and provides essential resources to our growing manufacturing sector.  Today, we recognize the environmental and economic benefits that recycling produces, and we celebrate all those who do their part to build a more prosperous and sustainable future.
 
Americans generate approximately 250 million tons of municipal solid waste every year.  But more of this trash -- from our homes, workplaces, and classrooms -- could be recycled or reused.  Individuals can compost their food waste and donate items that are no longer needed.  The choices we make as we shop can also help reduce waste.  Families and individuals can buy products that use less packaging, purchase goods made with recycled resources, and avoid disposable materials whenever possible.
