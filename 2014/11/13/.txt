The White House

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:

The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is authorized to exercise authority under Public Law 85-804, as amended (50 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.

The USAID is exercising functions in connection with the national defense in the course of complying with its humanitarian mandate, and there is a relevant state of national emergency that authorizes use of Public Law 85-804.  I deem that the authorization provided in this memorandum and actions taken pursuant to that authorization would facilitate the national defense.
