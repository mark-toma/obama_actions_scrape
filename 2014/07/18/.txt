SUBJECT: Proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement Between
the Government of the United States of America
and the Government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland for
Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for
Mutual Defense Purposes

I have reviewed and concur with the positions taken in your joint letter to me of July 9, 2014, recommending approval of a proposed Amendment to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes of July 3, 1958, as amended (the &quot;1958 Agreement&quot;).

I note from your joint recommendation and concur with your assessment that the United Kingdom, by participating with the United States pursuant to an international agreement, is making substantial and material contributions to the mutual defense and security. The proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement will permit cooperation that will further improve our mutual defense posture and support our interests under NATO. I hereby: approve the proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement; determine that performance under the proposed Amendment will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security; approve the program outlined in this Amendment and determine that such program will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security; and authorize the execution of the proposed Amendment for the Government of the United States in a manner specified by the Secretary of State.
