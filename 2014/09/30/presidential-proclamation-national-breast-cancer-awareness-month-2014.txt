This year, more than 230,000 women and 2,000 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer in America.  The heartache and the pain of this disease will touch too many of our mothers, fathers, daughters, and sisters, and too many families will bear these burdens.  During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize all those who know the anguish of breast cancer, and we redouble our efforts to improve care and bring attention to this disease.
 
When breast cancer is caught early, treatments work best and survival rates increase.  That is why all women and men should be familiar with the risk factors and symptoms of this disease.  I encourage women to speak with their health care provider about the risk of breast cancer and the importance of recommended mammograms -- breast cancer screenings that play an essential role in early detection.  Whether you are looking for information about breast cancer prevention, treatment of metastatic breast cancer, or information on the latest research, all Americans can learn more by visiting www.Cancer.gov
