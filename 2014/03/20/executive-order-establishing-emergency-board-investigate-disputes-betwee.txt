The White House

The disputes heretofore have not been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (RLA).

A first emergency board to investigate and report on the disputes was established on November 22, 2013, by Executive Order 13654 of November 21, 2013. The emergency board terminated upon issuance of its report. Subsequently, its recommendations were not accepted by the parties.

A party empowered by the RLA has requested that the President establish a second emergency board pursuant to section 9A of the RLA (45 U.S.C. 159a).

Section 9A(e) of the RLA provides that the President, upon such request, shall appoint a second emergency board to investigate and report on the disputes.

NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 9A of the RLA, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board (Board)

Sec. 2. Report

Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions

Sec. 4. Records Maintenance

Sec. 5. Expiration
