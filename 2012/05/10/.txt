The White House

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to modernize our regulatory system and to reduce unjustified regulatory burdens and costs, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section

Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), states that our regulatory system &quot;must measure, and seek to improve, the actual results of regulatory requirements.&quot; To promote this goal, that Executive Order requires agencies not merely to conduct a single exercise, but to engage in &quot;periodic review of existing significant regulations.&quot; Pursuant to section 6(b) of that Executive Order, agencies are required to develop retrospective review plans to review existing significant regulations in order to &quot;determine whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed.&quot; The purpose of this requirement is to &quot;make the agency&#39;s regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.&quot;

In response to Executive Order 13563, agencies have developed and made available for public comment retrospective review plans that identify over five hundred initiatives. A small fraction of those initiatives, already finalized or formally proposed to the public, are anticipated to eliminate billions of dollars in regulatory costs and tens of millions of hours in annual paperwork burdens. Significantly larger savings are anticipated as the plans are implemented and as action is taken on additional initiatives.

As a matter of longstanding practice and to satisfy statutory obligations, many agencies engaged in periodic review of existing regulations prior to the issuance of Executive Order 13563. But further steps should be taken, consistent with law, agency resources, and regulatory priorities, to promote public participation in retrospective review, to modernize our regulatory system, and to institutionalize regular assessment of significant regulations.
