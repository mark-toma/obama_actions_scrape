# obama_actions_scrape

This project contains some quick [or not-so-quick] and dirty MATLAB foo scraping of data from Obama's archived website.

The website is accessed at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ and the targeted entries are listed at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions.

The content of these entries is not copyright protected since, "Pursuant to federal law, government-produced materials appearing on this site are not copyright protected." This can be verified at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/copyright.

The purpose of this mini project is to have searchable plain text file on a local machine.
