A PROCLAMATION

Underpinning American democracy and upholding the founding principles of our Nation, the law enshrines our bedrock belief in equality and justice for all.  Central to securing these ideals is ensuring that every American's fundamental, constitutionally-guaranteed individual rights are protected, and by respecting these rights, our Nation demonstrates its unwavering dedication to the law.  Our fidelity to the rule of law has guided our country in times of trial and triumph, and it helps us keep faith with our Founders and with generations to come.

On this year's Law Day, we celebrate 50 years since the Supreme Court's ruling in Miranda 

The Court's decision in Miranda

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.
