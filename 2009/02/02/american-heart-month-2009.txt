AMERICAN HEART MONTH, 2009

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
     Together, we can turn the tide on the number one killer of American women and men.  Heart disease claims more lives each year than all forms of cancer combined.  During American Heart Month, we renew our commitment to promoting heart disease awareness.  It is never too late to start protecting heart health.
