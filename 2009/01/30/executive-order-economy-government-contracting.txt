The White House  - - - - - - -  ECONOMY IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING     By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America     Section 1.  To promote economy and efficiency in Government contracting, certain costs that are not directly related to the contractors' provision of goods and services to the Government shall be unallowable for payment, thereby directly reducing Government expenditures.  This order is also consistent with the policy of the United States     Sec. 2.  It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration of Government contracts, contracting departments and agencies, when they enter into, receive proposals for, or make disbursements pursuant to a contract as to which certain costs are treated as unallowable, shall treat as unallowable the costs of any activities undertaken to persuade employees -- whether employees of the recipient of the Federal disbursements or of any other entity -- to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of the employees' own choosing.  Such unallowable costs shall be excluded from any billing, claim, proposal, or disbursement applicable to any such Federal Government contract.
