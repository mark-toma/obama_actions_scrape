                Memorandum for the assistant to the president and Chief of Staff     Subject:      Pay Freeze      The United States is in a period of severe economic stress. Too many Americans have lost their jobs, their homes, their health insurance, or a substantial part of their retirement savings, and many more feel uncertain about the future.    In these circumstances, Government must act forcefully and creatively to stimulate our economic recovery, investing in infrastructure, innovative energy technologies, and education. It must act quickly to provide assistance to average Americans.    Many have accepted the call to serve in Government and to assist me in restoring a sound economy and in improving the lives of average Americans. In this challenging economic period, it is only appropriate that senior officials on the White House staff forgo pay increases until further notice.
