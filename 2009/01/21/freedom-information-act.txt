                MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES     SUBJECT:      Freedom of Information Act     A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires transparency. As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, &quot;sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.&quot; In our democracy, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government. At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike.
