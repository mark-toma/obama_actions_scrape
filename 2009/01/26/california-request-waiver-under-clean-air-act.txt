            MEMORANDUM FOR 
            
            THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
            
        
    

SUBJECT: State of California Request for Waiver Under 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), the Clean Air Act
Under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets emissions standards for new motor vehicles. California may also adopt standards for new motor vehicles if the Administrator of the EPA, based on criteria set out in the statute, waives the general statutory prohibition on State adoption or enforcement of emissions standards. Other States may adopt emissions standards for new motor vehicles if they are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted and comply with other statutory criteria.
For decades, the EPA has granted the State of California such waivers. The EPA's final decision to deny California's application for a waiver permitting the State to adopt limitations on greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles was published in the Federal Register on March 6, 2008.
