NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH, SEPTEMBER 2009
- - - - - - -
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
As a Nation, we have made significant progress in the fight against prostate cancer. Over the last decade, prostate cancer mortality rates have fallen substantially. Yet, despite this progress, among men in the United States prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. One in six men in this country will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity to renew our commitment to find better ways to prevent, detect, and control this disease.
Prostate cancer affects both those stricken with the disease and their families, often occurring when they least expect it. The cancer does not discriminate among husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons, and it does not differentiate on race, age, or income. Americans of every background know its
dangers. Families share in the struggles of prostate cancer,bearing the emotional and financial concerns along with the afflicted.
My Administration supports prevention efforts and research to develop better screening tests, uncover more effective treatments, and ensure quality care for all who are diagnosed with this illness. We must ensure that more men are educated about all aspects of the disease including prevention, early detection and possible treatment options. To expand our knowledge of this cancer, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are playing leading roles in research. Their work is helping to reduce the burden of prostate cancer and save lives for generations to come.
