BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
Since our Nation's founding, working Americans have carried us through times of challenge and uncertainty and propelled America through eras of peace and prosperity. They have long
formed the backbone of our Nation's economy, and they will continue to lead our Nation to new heights in the years to come.
Working Americans helped lay the foundation for our Nation's progress over the generations. Brick by brick, they built the infrastructure that powered the engine of our economy. With firm resolve and commitment, they constructed our cities and towns, and with unparalleled skill they manufactured the goods and provided the services needed by Americans and people around the world. They have prepared our children for the challenges ahead and cared for the sick and the elderly. Today, we commemorate the many contributions labor has made to our Nation.
