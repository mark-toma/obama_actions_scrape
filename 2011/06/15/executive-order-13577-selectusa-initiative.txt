ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SELECTUSA INITIATIVE

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to support private sector job creation and enhance economic growth by encouraging and supporting business investment in the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1.  Policy

As a place to do business, the United States offers a hardworking, diverse, and educated workforce, strong protection of intellectual property rights, a predictable and transparent legal system, relatively low taxes, highly developed infrastructure, and access to the world&#39;s most lucrative consumer market.  We welcome both domestic and foreign businesses to invest across the broad spectrum of the U.S. market.

The Federal Government lacks the centralized investment promotion infrastructure and resources to attract business investment that is often found in other industrialized countries.  Currently, States and cities are competing against foreign governments to attract business investment.  Our Nation needs to retain business investment and pursue and win new investment in the United States by better marketing our strengths, providing clear, complete, and consistent information, and removing unnecessary obstacles to investment.

Sec. 2.  SelectUSA Initiative

(b)  Functions

(i)    The Initiative shall coordinate outreach and engagement by the Federal Government to promote the United States as the premier location to operate a business.

(ii)   The Initiative shall serve as an ombudsman that facilitates the resolution of issues involving Federal programs or activities related to pending investments.

(iii)  The Initiative shall provide information to domestic and foreign firms on:  the investment climate in the United States; Federal programs and incentives available to investors; and State and local economic development organizations.

(iv)   The Initiative shall report quarterly to the President through the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Security Staff, describing its outreach activities, requests for information received, and efforts to resolve issues.

(c)  Administration

(d)  Federal Interagency Investment Working Group

(i)    There is established the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group (Working Group), which will be convened and chaired by the Initiative&#39;s Executive Director, in coordination with the Director of the National Economic Council.

Senior officials shall be designated by and report to the Deputy Secretary or official at the equivalent level of their respective offices, departments, and agencies.

(iii)  The Working Group shall coordinate activities to promote business investment and respond to specific issues that affect business investment decisions.

(iv)   The Department of Commerce shall provide funding and administrative support for the Working Group to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.

(e)  Department and Agency Participation

(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
