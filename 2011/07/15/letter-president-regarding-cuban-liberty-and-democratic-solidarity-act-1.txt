Dear Mr. Chairman: (Dear Madam Chairman:) (Dear Representative:) (Dear Senator:)

Consistent with section 306(c)(2) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-114) (the &quot;Act&quot;), I hereby determine and report to the Congress that suspension, for 6 months beyond August 1, 2011, of the right to bring an action under title III of the Act is necessary to the national interests of the United States and will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba.

Sincerely,

BARACK OBAMA
