The White House

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)

     Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the &quot;order&quot;) that takes additional steps with respect to the Government of Syria&#39;s continuous escalation of violence against the people of Syria    including through attacks on protestors, arrests and harassment of protestors and political activists, and repression of democratic change, overseen and executed by numerous elements of the Syrian government    and with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004, relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, and in Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, and expanded in scope in Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011.

     In Executive Order 13338, the President found that the actions of the Government of Syria constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and declared a national emergency to deal with that threat.  To address that threat and to implement the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law 108 175), the President in Executive Order 13338 blocked the property of certain persons and imposed additional prohibitions on certain transactions with respect to Syria.  In Executive Order 13572, I expanded the scope of that national emergency and imposed additional sanctions.

     The order blocks the property and interests in property of persons listed in the Annex to the order.  The order also provides criteria for designations, and the resulting blocking of the property and interests in property, of persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:

to be a senior official of the Government of Syria;

     The order was effective at 1:00 p.m. eastern daylight time on May 18, 2011.  All executive agencies of the United States Government are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of the order.

     I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.

Sincerely,

BARACK OBAMA
