A PROCLAMATION

    Across America, millions of men and women experience vision loss or are affected by low vision or blindness.  During Save Your Vision Week, we reinforce the importance of routine eye care and remind all Americans to take action to safeguard their eyesight.

    Vision is important to our everyday activities, and we can all take steps to protect and prolong our eye health.  Through Healthy People 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services&#39; science based agenda to prevent disease and promote health, our country&#39;s leading health officials have identified interventions to preserve sight and prevent blindness.  Though some eye diseases and injuries are preventable or treatable with early detection and timely treatment, many Americans do not receive recommended eye exams and screenings.  Healthy People 2020 advises each American to get vision check ups regularly in order to identify vision impairments at an early stage.
