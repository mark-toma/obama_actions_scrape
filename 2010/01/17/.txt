This Executive Order will help the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security support the relief effort in Haiti. It will be used on a limited basis, principally to support targeted functions associated with this humanitarian mission. For instance, it will allow for the call-up of reserve medical personnel to replace those deployed on the hospital ship Comfort and it will allow for the deployment of a Coast Guard unit that will help provide port security.
