SUBJECT: Attempted Terrorist Attack on December 25,2009: Intelligence, Screening, and Watchlisting System Corrective Actions

After receiving the conclusions ofthe White House-led review of the U.S. watchlisting system and the performance of the intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement communities as related to the attempt to bring down a Detroit-bound flight on December 25 by detonating an explosive device, and a Department of Homeland Security-led review on Aviation Screening, Technology and Procedures; I have concluded that immediate actions must be taken to enhance the security of the American people. These actions are necessary given inherent systemic weaknesses and human errors revealed by the review of events leading up to December 25th. They also are required to ensure that the standards, practices, and business processes that have been in place since the aftermath of 9111 are appropriately robust to address the evolving terrorist threat facing our Nation in the coming years.
