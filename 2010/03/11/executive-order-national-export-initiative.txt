Section 1

The National Export Initiative (NEI) shall be an Administration initiative to improve conditions that directly affect the private sector&#39;s ability to export. The NEI will help meet my Administration&#39;s goal of doubling exports over the next 5 years by working to remove trade barriers abroad, by helping firms -- especially small businesses -- overcome the hurdles to entering new export markets, by assisting with financing, and in general by pursuing a Government-wide approach to export advocacy abroad, among other steps.

A member of the Export Promotion Cabinet may designate, to perform the NEI-related functions of that member, a senior official from the member&#39;s department or agency who is a full-time officer or employee. The Export Promotion Cabinet may also establish subgroups consisting of its members or their designees, and, as appropriate, representatives of other departments and agencies.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
