The White House

    The time to act is now.  Every year our overdependence on fossil fuels sends billions of dollars overseas to buy foreign oil instead of supporting American workers and farmers, rewarding innovation, and developing clean energy industries here at home.  Fossil fuel pollution has already begun to change our climate, posing a grave and growing danger to our economy, our national security, and our environment.

 

    Over the last year and a half, we have taken unprecedented action to build a clean energy economy.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act made a $90 billion down payment on a clean energy future for our country.  This critical investment is expanding manufacturing capacity for clean energy technologies; advancing vehicle and fuel technologies; spurring the development of renewable fuels; and catalyzing progress towards a bigger, better, smarter electric grid; all while creating new jobs that cannot be shipped overseas.  My Administration also set tough new fuel-economy standards and the first greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light trucks.  Additionally, I signed an Executive Order that empowers the Federal Government to lead by example by cutting its energy use.  As our Nation&#39;s single largest energy consumer, the Federal Government has an obligation to improve its energy efficiency, increase its use of renewable energy, cut greenhouse gas pollution, and leverage its purchasing power to advance a clean energy economy.

 

    Across the country, citizens themselves are helping to lead the way.  In small towns and city neighborhoods, on college campuses and in houses of worship, in office buildings and on the shop floor, Americans are standing up and building a clean energy economy together through community information, education, and action.
