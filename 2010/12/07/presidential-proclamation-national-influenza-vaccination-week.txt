Last year, as the world prepared for a pandemic of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, we were reminded of the severity and unpredictability of this serious disease.  Thousands of Americans suffered serious complications from the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in hospitalization or even death.  Tragically, influenza and flu related complications take American lives each year.  During National Influenza Vaccination Week, we remind all Americans that the flu vaccine is safe and effective in preventing the spread of flu viruses.

Annual flu vaccination is recommended for all people 6 months of age and older.  Under the new health reform law, the Affordable Care Act, individuals enrolled in new group or individual private health plans have no co-payment or deductible for influenza vaccinations.  While the flu can make even healthy children and adults very sick, certain individuals are at greater risk for serious complications from the flu.  Pregnant women, young children, older adults, as well as people living with HIV, chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, neurologic conditions, and certain other chronic health conditions are especially encouraged to get a flu vaccine.  Our Nation&#39;s health care workers and those caring for infants under 6 months of age should also be vaccinated to protect themselves and those within their care.
